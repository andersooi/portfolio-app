# Anders's Portfolio Website 💻

This is the first portfolio website that I have done, which showcases some of my most recent experiences and projects that I built. 

### Idea 💡

I wanted to go for a more minimalistic design that emphasises the main highlights of my experiences and projects thus far. During my research, I was inspired by a few portfolio projects, mainly [@rajshekhar26](https://github.com/rajshekhar26/cleanfolio), [@soumyajit4419](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio) and [@mirayatech](https://www.miraya.tech/).

I tried to mix and match ideas from each portfolio and eventually settled on the current design.

### Technologies 🛠️

- `react`
- `tailwindCSS`

### Learning Points ☝️

Since there wasn't really any tutorials based on the three implementations I mentioned above, there was a lot of reverse engineering and looking up online the different functionalities in CSS and React. 

After a lot of trial and error, I feel that I have a better understanding of structuring elements on a website and styling them. 

Learning how to create a resuable mapping function for the `Experiences` and `Projects` section was really beneficial too, which cut down a lot of unnecessary code. 

### Further Improvements 🔧

Ideally, the website should be able to allow users to toggle between dark and light mode for a better user experience. Currently, I feel that the light design provides a more clean and aesthetic feel compared to a dark design, but I won't rule out the opportunity to work on refactoring the site to account for dark mode.

### Deployment 🚀

The web application is deployed using Vercel and can be accessed by the following [link](https://anders-portfolio.vercel.app/).
